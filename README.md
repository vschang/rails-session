ðŸŽ§ Session is a rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by Valerie Chang (USA), Pablo Barcena (Spain) and Victor Serapiglia (Venezuela) in just two weeks! Session was designed as a solution to the frustration that we were unable to share our music with friends on a unified app, but had to do so instead over separate messaging platforms in the form of a link. Session takes care of the social media aspect that the majority of music streaming services lack. Through a Spotify API, users are able to create posts to based on a song artist or album they'd like to share. âœ¨
